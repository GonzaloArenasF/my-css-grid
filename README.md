# Grid System using CSS Grid

This basic grid system was built using only CSS Grids statements and Media Queries for the responsive behavior. Also, the design pattern for building the grid is First Mobile

The breakpoints used are:
  - Small devices: 576px;
  - Medium devices: 768px;
  - Large devices: 992px;
  - Extra large devices: 1200px;

The grid is set for work with 12 columns, and you can use it with the CSS classes below:
  - col-[ Nº Columns ]: Extra Small devices
  - col-sm-[ Nº Columns ]: Small devices
  - col-md-[ Nº Columns ]: Medium devices
  - col-lg-[ Nº Columns ]: Large devices
  - col-xl-[ Nº Columns ]: Extra Large devices

For de develop I used SASS under the 7-1 pattern and SASS tool for compiling the code.
~~~
 1. npm i -g sass
 2. sass assets/sass/main.scss:assets/css/main.css
~~~

> This grid system is for free using, only if you include my references in the proyect adding my full name and repository direction.
